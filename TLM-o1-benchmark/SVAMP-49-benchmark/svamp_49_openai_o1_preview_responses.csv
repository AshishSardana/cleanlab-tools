"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",1,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many crackers and cakes each of Matthew's 28 friends received, given that Matthew had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially.

1. **Crackers per person:**
   - Total crackers = 13
   - Number of friends = 28
   - Crackers per person = Total crackers ÷ Number of friends = \( \frac{13}{28} \) crackers per person.

2. **Cakes per person:**
   - Total cakes = 15
   - Number of friends = 28
   - Cakes per person = Total cakes ÷ Number of friends = \( \frac{15}{28} \) cakes per person.

Since 13 and 28 are coprime (they have no common divisors other than 1), \( \frac{13}{28} \) is already in its simplest form. Similarly, 15 and 28 are coprime, so \( \frac{15}{28} \) is also in its simplest form.

**Therefore, each person ate \( \frac{13}{28} \) crackers and \( \frac{15}{28} \) cakes.**

**Answer:**
Each person ate 13⁄28 crackers and 15⁄28 cakes.",0
"Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails in the afternoon and some more in the evening. If he received a total of 10 emails in the day How many emails did Jack receive in the afternoon?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",3,"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many emails Jack received in the afternoon.

- **Morning emails:** 6
- **Afternoon emails:** Let's call this number **A**
- **Evening emails:** Let's call this number **E**

We are given that:

- **Total emails in the day:** 10

From the information, we know Jack received **3 emails in the afternoon**. However, to check for consistency:

\[ \text{Total emails} = \text{Morning emails} + \text{Afternoon emails} + \text{Evening emails} \]
\[ 10 = 6 + 3 + E \]
\[ E = 10 - 6 - 3 \]
\[ E = 1 \]

So, Jack received **1 email in the evening**.

"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",949,"To solve this problem, we'll assume that the number of visitors to Buckingham Palace decreases uniformly over the 25-day period from 703 visitors on the first day to 246 visitors on the last day. This forms an arithmetic sequence where:

- **First term (a₁)**: 703 visitors
- **Last term (aₙ)**: 246 visitors
- **Number of terms (n)**: 25 days

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:

\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)
\]

Plugging in the given values:

\[
S_{25} = \frac{25}{2} (703 + 246) = \frac{25}{2} \times 949 = 25 \times 474.5 = 11,862.5
\]

Since we can't have half a visitor, we'll round to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the total number of visitors over the 25 days is **11,863**.

**Answer:** 11863",0
"Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",2,"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cups of flour Mary has already put in, given the information provided.

**Given:**
- Total flour required: 11 cups
- Total sugar required: 7 cups
- Mary has already added some cups of flour.
- She still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar.

**Assuming** Mary hasn't added any sugar yet (since only flour addition is mentioned), the amount of sugar she still needs is the total sugar required, which is 7 cups.

According to the problem, she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, so:

Amount of flour she still needs = Amount of sugar she still needs + 2

Let's plug in the numbers:

Amount of flour she still needs = 7 cups (sugar) + 2 cups = 9 cups

Since the total flour required is 11 cups, and she still needs 9 cups, the amount of flour she has already added is:

Amount of flour already added = Total flour required - Amount of flour still needed
Amount of flour already added = 11 cups - 9 cups = **2 cups**

So, Mary has already put in **2 cups** of flour.

"Last week Fred had 111 dollars and Jason had 40 dollars. Fred washed cars over the weekend and now has 115 dollars. Jason delivered newspapers and now has 44 dollars. How much money did they earn by washing cars?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",4,"To solve this problem, let's determine how much money Fred and Jason earned by washing cars.

1. **Fred's earnings from washing cars:**
   - **Initial amount:** \$111
   - **Final amount after washing cars:** \$115
   - **Fred's earnings:** \$115 - \$111 = **\$4**

2. **Jason's earnings:**
   - **Initial amount:** \$40
   - **Final amount after delivering newspapers:** \$44
   - **Jason did not wash cars; he delivered newspapers.** Therefore, his earnings are not from washing cars.

3. **Total money earned by washing cars:**
   - Since only Fred washed cars, the total money earned by washing cars is **\$4**.

**Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:**

"The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus. How many buses are needed to take the trip?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",29,"To solve this problem, we'll first determine the total number of students and then calculate the number of buses needed based on the seating capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Students**

The school has 87 classrooms, and there are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students.

Since there are 58 students **distributed equally** among 87 classrooms, we calculate the number of students per classroom:

\[
\text{Students per classroom} = \frac{58}{87} \approx 0.6667
\]

This calculation results in less than one student per classroom, which doesn't make practical sense. This suggests a mistake in the problem statement.

However, if we interpret the problem differently, perhaps **there are 58 students in each classroom** instead of 58 students in total. Let's proceed with that assumption.

Total number of students:

\[
\text{Total students} = \text{Number of classrooms} \times \text{Students per classroom} = 87 \times 58 = 5,046 \text{ students}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the Number of Buses Needed**

If there are 2 seats on each school bus, it means each bus can carry 2 students, which is impractical. It's more likely that the problem meant ""2 students per seat"" or that each bus has multiple seats with 2 students per seat.

Assuming each bus can carry a certain number of students, but since the seating capacity per bus isn't provided, we cannot accurately calculate the number of buses needed.

**Conclusion**

Due to inconsistencies and missing information in the problem statement, we cannot determine the number of buses needed.

**Answer:** Cannot determine the number of buses needed due to insufficient information.",0
"Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven who has 8 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 5 peaches. How many more peaches does Jake have than Jill?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",5,"To solve this problem, let's assign variables to each person's number of peaches:

- Let \( Jk \) be the number of peaches Jake has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of peaches Steven has.
- Let \( Jl \) be the number of peaches Jill has.

From the problem statements:
1. **Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven**: \( Jk = S - 3 \).
2. **Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill**: \( S = Jl + 8 \).
3. **Steven has 5 peaches**: \( S = 5 \).

First, find Jill's number of peaches:
\[ S = Jl + 8 \]
\[ 5 = Jl + 8 \]
\[ Jl = 5 - 8 \]
\[ Jl = -3 \]

Next, find Jake's number of peaches:
\[ Jk = S - 3 \]
\[ Jk = 5 - 3 \]
\[ Jk = 2 \]

Finally, find how many more peaches Jake has than Jill:
\[ \text{Difference} = Jk - Jl \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 2 - (-3) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 5 \]

"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",745,"To determine the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace within 57 days, we'll use the information provided and make reasonable assumptions based on patterns.

**Given:**

- On the day Rachel visited, there were **557 visitors**.
- The **previous day** had **188 visitors**.

It appears that the visitor numbers might follow a repeating pattern every 2 days:

- Day 1: 188 visitors
- Day 2: 557 visitors
- Day 3: 188 visitors
- Day 4: 557 visitors
- ...

**Calculations:**

1. **Determine the number of complete 2-day cycles in 57 days:**

   \[
   \text{Number of cycles} = \left\lfloor \dfrac{57}{2} \right\rfloor = 28 \text{ cycles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total visitors in these 28 cycles:**

   - Each cycle consists of 2 days with a total of \(188 + 557 = 745\) visitors.
   - Total visitors in 28 cycles:

     \[
     28 \text{ cycles} \times 745 \text{ visitors/cycle} = 20,860 \text{ visitors}
     \]

3. **Account for the remaining day:**

   - 57 days total minus 28 cycles (56 days) leaves **1 extra day**.
   - The pattern suggests the next day should be like Day 1 (since the pattern repeats every 2 days), so we'll add the visitors from Day 1, which is **188 visitors**.

4. **Calculate the grand total:**

   \[
   \text{Total visitors} = 20,860 \text{ visitors} + 188 \text{ visitors} = 21,048 \text{ visitors}

"Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 19 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Doug lose?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",17,"To solve this problem, we'll set up an equation based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be the number of marbles Doug originally had. Then Ed had \( D + 2 \) marbles because Ed had 2 more than Doug.

After Doug loses marbles, let's let \( L \) represent the number of marbles Doug loses. So Doug now has \( D - L \) marbles.

We are told that now Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. So:

"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",57,"Based on the information provided in the problem, it's apparent that there is a discrepancy in the wording. The problem mentions that Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to Buckingham Palace on ""that day,"" 191 visitors came the previous day, and 457 visitors the day before that. Then it asks: ""How many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?""

We can infer that there is a typo in the problem statement because we do not have data for the previous 245 days, only for the previous 2 days. It seems logical that the problem should have asked: ""How many more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the previous **2** days?""

With that correction, we proceed to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the total visitors on the previous two days:
   \(191 + 457 = 648\)

2. Subtract this total from the number of visitors on ""that day"":
   \(705 - 648 = 57\)

Therefore, 57 more visitors visited Buckingham Palace on that day than on the previous two days combined.

"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 92 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace before that day?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",522,"It appears you're being asked, ""How many people visited Buckingham Palace before the day when 103 visitors came?"" Given that the day with 103 visitors is the earliest day mentioned, and no prior visitor numbers are provided, it's reasonable to conclude that no information is given about visitors before that day. This implies that before that day, there were **zero** visitors to the Buckingham Palace (perhaps because it was not open to visitors before then). Therefore, based on the information provided, the answer in Arabic numerals is:

"Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 36 of the pickers that they fill 8 drums of grapes per day. How many days will it take to fill 240 drums of grapes?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",30,"To solve the problem, we'll first interpret the given information carefully.

We are told that 36 pickers ""fill 8 drums of grapes per day."" The key is to understand whether each picker fills 8 drums per day or if all 36 pickers together fill 8 drums per day.

Given the context, it's more reasonable to interpret that collectively, the 36 pickers fill 8 drums per day. If each picker filled 8 drums per day, they would collectively fill \(36 \times 8 = 288\) drums per day, which would mean they fill more than the total required drums in a single day. This would not match with the question asking ""How many days will it take...""

So, assuming the 36 pickers together fill 8 drums per day, we can calculate the number of days required to fill 240 drums:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total drums needed}}{\text{Drums filled per day}} = \frac{240}{8} = 30.

"Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters. It took Frank 660 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",44,"To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of chapters by the total number of days it took him to finish the book.

Total chapters = 15  
Total days = 660  

Chapters per day = Total chapters ÷ Total days  
Chapters per day = 15 ÷ 660  
Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 15:  
15 ÷ 15 = 1  
660 ÷ 15 = 44  

So, Chapters per day = 1⁄44

Therefore, Frank read **1⁄44** chapters per day.

"3 birds were sitting on the fence. 2 more birds and 6 more storks came to join them. How many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",1,"First, we'll tally the number of birds and storks.

- Initially, there are **3 birds** sitting on the fence.
- **2 more birds** join them, bringing the total number of birds to \( 3 + 2 = 5 \).
- **6 storks** also come to join them.

Now, we have:

- **Total birds:** 5
- **Total storks:** 6

To find out how many more storks than birds are on the fence, subtract the number of birds from the number of storks:

\( 6 \text{ storks} - 5 \text{ birds} = 1 \)

"Paul had 21 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 42 new ones. If he has 15 books now How many more books did he sell than he bought?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",6,"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

**Step 1: Understand the Initial Situation**

- Paul starts with **21 books**.

**Step 2: Account for Books Sold**

- Let’s let **\( s \)** represent the number of books Paul sold.
- After selling, he has **\( 21 - s \)** books.

**Step 3: Account for Books Bought**

- Paul buys **42 new books**, so now he has:
  \[
  (21 - s) + 42 = 63 - s
  \]

**Step 4: Use the Final Number of Books to Solve for \( s \)**

- We know that after all transactions, Paul has **15 books**. So:
  \[
  63 - s = 15

"Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",21,"To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

Let \( A \) = the number of apples Adam has.
Let \( J \) = the number of apples Jackie has.
Let \( H \) = the number of apples ""He"" has.

From the problem statements:

1. Together, Adam and Jackie have 12 apples:
\[ A + J = 12 \]

2. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie:
\[ A = J + 8 \]

Substitute equation 2 into equation 1:
\[ (J + 8) + J = 12 \]
\[ 2J + 8 = 12 \]
\[ 2J = 4 \]
\[ J = 2 \]

Now find \( A \):
\[ A = J + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10 \]

""He"" has 9 more apples than Adam and Jackie together:
\[ H = (A + J) + 9 = 12 + 9 = 21 \]

Answer: **21**",1
"Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",20,"To solve the problem, we'll translate it into algebraic equations:

1. Let the number of apples Jackie has be \( x \).
2. Then, Adam has \( x + 4 \) apples (since he has 4 more than Jackie).
3. Together, Adam and Jackie have \( x + (x + 4) = 2x + 4 \) apples.
4. It's given that Adam and Jackie together have 14 apples, so \( 2x + 4 = 14 \).
5. Solve for \( x \):
   \[ 2x + 4 = 14 \]
   \[ 2x = 10 \]
   \[ x = 5 \]
6. So, Jackie has 5 apples, and Adam has \( 5 + 4 = 9 \) apples.
7. Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie combined, so Bob has \( 14 + 6 = 20 \) apples.

**Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:**

"Lewis earns $ 368 every week during the 1359 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 388 rent every week How much money does he pay as rent during the harvest season?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",527292,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Lewis pays in rent over the harvest season. The calculation is straightforward:

1. **Number of Weeks in Harvest Season**: \(1359\) weeks
2. **Weekly Rent**: \(\$388\)

**Total Rent Paid** = Number of Weeks × Weekly Rent
\[ \text{Total Rent Paid} = 1359 \times \$388 \]

Now, compute the multiplication:

\[
\begin{align*}
1359 \times 388 &= (1359 \times 300) + (1359 \times 80) + (1359 \times 8) \\
&= 407,700 + 108,720 + 10,872 \\
&= 527,292
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, Lewis pays a total of **\$527,292** in rent during the harvest season.

"There were 21 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 15 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",6,"To solve this problem, we'll set up an equation based on the changes in the number of roses in the vase.

**Let \( x \) be the number of roses Jessica cut from her garden.**

Initially, there were 21 roses in the vase.

Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase: **subtract 34**.
She added \( x \) new roses to the vase: **add \( x \)**.
After these changes, there are 15 roses in the vase.

So the equation is:
\[ 21 - 34 + x = 15 \]

Simplify:
\[ -13 + x = 15 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 15 + 13 \]
\[ x = 28 \]

So, Jessica cut **28 roses** from her garden.

She threw away 34 roses and cut 28 new roses.

The difference is:
\[ 34 - 28 = 6 \]

"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 512 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",1791,"To find the total number of visitors to Buckingham Palace over the past 89 days, let's analyze the pattern in the visitor counts provided:

- **Day 1 (Today):** 512 visitors
- **Day 2 (Yesterday):** 471 visitors
- **Day 3 (Day before yesterday):** 808 visitors

Observing these numbers, notice that they repeat every 3 days:

1. **Day 1:** 512
2. **Day 2:** 471
3. **Day 3:** 808
4. **Day 4:** 512
5. **Day 5:** 471
6. **Day 6:** 808
7. **...** and so on.

Now, calculate the total visitors for each complete 3-day cycle:

- **Sum of one cycle (3 days):** 512 + 471 + 808 = **1,791** visitors

Determine how many complete 3-day cycles there are in 89 days:

- **Number of complete cycles:** 89 ÷ 3 = **29 cycles** with a remainder of **2 days**

Calculate the total visitors for the 29 complete cycles:

- **Total for 29 cycles:** 29 × 1,791 = **51,939** visitors

Now, account for the remaining 2 days after the 29 complete cycles. The pattern indicates the sequence repeats, so the visitor counts for the next two days are:

- **Day 88:** 512 visitors
- **Day 89:** 471 visitors

Calculate the total visitors for these 2 days:

- **Total for remaining 2 days:** 512 + 471 = **983** visitors

Finally, add the totals:

- **Grand total:** 51,939 (complete cycles) + 983 (remaining days) = **52,922** visitors

**Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is:** **52922**",0
"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",274,"To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total visitors over the past 327 days**: 406 visitors.

2. **Visitors on the current day**: 132 visitors.

We are asked to find out **how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on the previous day**.

First, let's calculate the total number of visitors over the **previous 326 days** (excluding the current day):

- **Total visitors over 327 days** = **Visitors over previous 326 days** + **Visitors on the current day**.

So,

\[
\text{Visitors over previous 326 days} = \text{Total visitors over 327 days} - \text{Visitors on the current day}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
\text{Visitors over previous 326 days} = 406 - 132 = 274
\]

Now, we know that **274 visitors** came to the palace over the previous 326 days. However, the question specifically asks for the number of visitors **on the previous day** (just one day, not the total over 326 days). Since we don't have information about the daily visitor distribution over those 326 days, and assuming that all the visitors came on the previous day (which makes sense given the unusual high numbers compared to the average), we can infer that:

- **Visitors on the previous day** = 274 visitors.

"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",784,"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many visitors came to Buckingham Palace on the day Rachel visited, based on the information provided.

**Given:**
- Total visitors in the past 85 days: **829**
- Visitors on the previous day: **45**

First, let's find out the total number of visitors excluding the previous day:
- Total visitors excluding the previous day = **829 - 45 = 784**

Now, these 784 visitors visited over **84 days** (since we're excluding the previous day), so the average number of visitors per day during those days is:
- Average visitors per day = **784 visitors / 84 days = 9.333... ≈ 9 visitors**

Assuming that the number of visitors on the day Rachel visited is consistent with this average (since there's no information suggesting otherwise), the number of visitors on that day is approximately **9**.

**Therefore, the number of visitors who visited Buckingham Palace on that day is:**

"Baker made 81 cakes. Then he made 92 more cakes. He sold 46 of them. How many more cakes did baker make than those he sold?
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is: ",127,"To solve this problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of cakes made:**
   The baker first made 81 cakes and then made 92 more.
   \[ \text{Total cakes made} = 81 + 92 = 173 \]

2. **Determine the number of cakes sold:**
   The baker sold 46 cakes.
   \[ \text{Cakes sold} = 46 \]

3. **Find out how many more cakes were made than sold:**
   Subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made.
   \[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total cakes made} - \text{Cakes sold} \]
   \[ \text{Difference} = 173 - 46 = 127 \]

**Therefore, the baker made 127 more cakes than he sold.**
