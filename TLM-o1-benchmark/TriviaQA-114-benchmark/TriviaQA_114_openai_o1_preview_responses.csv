"How long does it take, approximately, for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth?
Therefore, the answer is",['about 8 minutes'],"It takes approximately **8 minutes and 20 seconds** for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth.

**Explanation:**

- The average distance between the Sun and the Earth is about **149.6 million kilometers** (which is defined as one Astronomical Unit, or 1 AU).
- The speed of light in a vacuum is about **299,792 kilometers per second**.

To calculate the time \( t \) it takes for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth:

\[
t = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{149,600,000\, \text{km}}{299,792\, \text{km/s}} \approx 499\, \text{seconds}
\]

- **499 seconds** is approximately **8 minutes and 19 seconds**.

Therefore, when we observe the Sun from Earth, we're actually seeing it as it was about 8 minutes and 20 seconds ago. This delay is due to the finite speed at which light travels through space.",1

Therefore, the answer is","['2', 'two']","Three U.S. Presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives:

2. **Bill Clinton** in 1998: He faced impeachment on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice related to the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Clinton was also acquitted by the Senate and served the remainder of his term.

3. **Donald Trump** was impeached **twice**:

It's important to note that impeachment by the House does not remove a president from office; removal requires a conviction by a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which has not happened to any U.S. president to date.",1

"On a standard dartboard, what number lies opposite 18?
Therefore, the answer is","['seven', '7']","On a standard dartboard, the numbers are arranged in a specific sequence designed to penalize inaccurate throws. The sequence starting from the top (12 o'clock position) and moving clockwise is as follows:

To find the number directly opposite **18**, we need to locate the number that is exactly halfway around the dartboard. Since there are 20 numbers, we can calculate the opposite position by adding 10 positions (half of 20) to the position of **18**.

- **Position of 18**: It is the 3rd number in the sequence.
- **Opposite position**: 3 (position of 18) + 10 = **13**

"What percentage of the earth's surface is covered by Europe?
Therefore, the answer is","['8', 'eight']","To determine what percentage of the Earth's surface is covered by Europe, we'll need to compare the area of Europe to the total surface area of the Earth.

**2. Surface Area of Europe:**

Europe covers an area of about **10,180,000 square kilometers** (km²).

**3. Calculating the Percentage:**

To find the percentage of the Earth's surface covered by Europe, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Area of Europe}}{\text{Total Surface Area of Earth}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{10,180,000 \text{ km²}}{510,072,000 \text{ km²}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

\[
\text{Percentage} \approx \left( 0.01996 \right) \times 100\% \approx 1.996\%
