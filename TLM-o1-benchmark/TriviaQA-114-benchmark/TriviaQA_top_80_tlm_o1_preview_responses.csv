"How long does it take, approximately, for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth?

Therefore, the answer is about **8 minutes and 20 seconds**.",0.985203225,1,"It takes approximately **8 minutes and 20 seconds** for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth.

**Explanation:**

- The average distance between the Sun and the Earth is about **149.6 million kilometers** (which is defined as one Astronomical Unit, or 1 AU).
- The speed of light in a vacuum is about **299,792 kilometers per second**.

To calculate the time \( t \) it takes for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth:

\[
t = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{149,600,000\, \text{km}}{299,792\, \text{km/s}} \approx 499\, \text{seconds}
\]

- **499 seconds** is approximately **8 minutes and 19 seconds**.

Therefore, when we observe the Sun from Earth, we're actually seeing it as it was about 8 minutes and 20 seconds ago. This delay is due to the finite speed at which light travels through space.",1

**1. Total Surface Area of the Earth:**

The Earth has a total surface area of approximately **510,072,000 square kilometers** (km²).

**2. Surface Area of Europe:**

Europe covers an area of about **10,180,000 square kilometers** (km²).

**3. Calculating the Percentage:**

To find the percentage of the Earth's surface covered by Europe, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Area of Europe}}{\text{Total Surface Area of Earth}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{10,180,000 \text{ km²}}{510,072,000 \text{ km²}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

\[
\text{Percentage} \approx \left( 0.01996 \right) \times 100\% \approx 1.996\%

**Therefore, Europe covers approximately 2% of the Earth's total surface area.**

One prevalent theory suggests that ""Kemo Sabe"" comes from the Ojibwe (Chippewa) phrase **""giimoozaabi,""** which translates to ""he who peeks"" or ""he who looks in secret,"" implying someone who is insightful or has secret knowledge. This interpretation aligns with the portrayal of the Lone Ranger as a perceptive and resourceful character.

Another theory points to the Apache language, but there is no direct translation of ""Kemo Sabe"" in Apache. Some speculate that it might be a rough approximation or anglicization of words from other Native languages or simply a creation for the show without a direct linguistic origin.

- **Position of 18**: It is the 3rd number in the sequence.
- **Opposite position**: 3 (position of 18) + 10 = **13**

4. **4**
5. **13**
