    "In this section, we demonstrate how Cleanlab Studio can automatically generate metadata for any text dataset. This metadata (returned as Cleanlab Columns) helps you discover various problems in your dataset and understand their severity. Currently, Cleanlab Studio mainly supports classification tasks, and thus requires a label column and only processes one desiginated text column per dataset. However, we can work around this by simply combining the ```instruction``` and ```response``` columns and using ```category``` as the label. If your dataset does not have an appropriate label cateogry, you can artificially generate labels by randomly assigning 0s and 1s to datapoints. The labeling issues metadata do not matter to us as we are only concerned about text issues.\n",
